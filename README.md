# Initial Experiments

This repository is a **showcase** of the beginning of my **programming journey**. My programming career started in **high school**, where I first discovered **C programming**. I found it incredibly fun and challenging, which led me to pursue **Electrical Engineering** at the **Faculty of Electrical Engineering**, where I continued to explore programming, especially in the realm of **microcontrollers**.

## The Beginning
- **High School**: My first exposure to programming was with **C**. I was immediately fascinated by the way code could control hardware and solve real-world problems.
- **Electrical Engineering**: At the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, C became the main language of choice for programming **microcontrollers**. This allowed me to dive deeper into embedded systems, creating small programs to control physical devices.

## Evolution of My Programming Skills
Though my focus started with microcontrollers, I quickly realized I could program beyond just embedded systems. I explored various aspects of programming, eventually expanding into different languages and areas of computer science. However, C remains the foundational language for much of my journey.

## Project Purpose
This repository isn't meant to be cloned or used as a tool, but rather a **personal showcase** of the starting point of my programming career. It includes early experiments and simple projects from my high school and early university days. These experiments reflect the early stages of my learning and development as a programmer, highlighting my growing interest in **C programming**, **embedded systems**, and **microcontroller programming**.

## Technologies and Tools Used:
- **C**: The primary programming language used for all early projects.
- **Microcontrollers**: Various small microcontrollers used for embedded programming.
- **Basic Hardware**: Used in conjunction with C to control physical devices.
